## About

The Uniswap sniping bot is an advanced decentralized trading solution built to scan tokens listed on Uniswap across Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum networks. It allows you to spot hidden opportunities before they gain traction, execute automatic buys, and lock in profits. With this tool, you can skip the manual token hunt, experiment with sniping strategies, and automate the most profitable ones.

Powered by our integrated DEX Screener, the Uniswap sniper can filter tokens by multiple parameters and either alert you once they match your criteria or instantly purchase them. Some of the factors you can use for token screening include:

- buying pressure
- price and trading volume trends
- liquidity and safety levels
- whale accumulation activity
- token age, FDV, and market cap
- plus many more

## Main features

- **On-chain event ingestion** — multi-provider RPC/WebSocket feeds to collect swaps, adds/removes, ticks, and logs from Uniswap V2/V3 pools and similar AMMs.
- **Slippage & fee modeling** — conservative estimators for expected slippage given pool depth and trade size; fee impact analytics for LPs and traders.
- **MEV/flash-loan pattern detection** — heuristics and classifiers to flag sequences consistent with rapid leverage or sandwich/atomic exploit patterns for investigation.
- **Arbitrage signal discovery (research only)** — tools to spot cross-DEX price divergences for research and validation (no automatic exploit routines).
- **Backtesting engine** — replay historic blocks and transactions to evaluate how strategies or detection rules would have performed.
- **Paper trading & simulation** — sandboxed runner that simulates order execution and liquidity impact without broadcasting on chain.
- **Alerting & integrations** — webhooks, Slack, email and SIEM connectors for operational teams and exchange defenders.
- **Audit logs & evidence capture** — immutable records of detected events, raw transactions, and metric snapshots for compliance and forensics.
- **Configurable risk scoring** — composite risk score per token/pool using volume spike, % price move, wallet concentration, and token age.
- **Dashboard & operator UI (read-only modes)** — visualization for pool heatmaps, recent anomalies, and historical comparisons.
- **Extensible plugin architecture** — add connectors for other DEXs, data providers, or custom detectors without changing core ingestion.
- **Secure operational patterns** — recommendations for signing, human approval workflows, and separation of analysis vs. execution responsibilities.
- **Documentation & compliance playbooks** — recommended mitigations, takedown workflows, and communication templates for exchanges and custodians.

## How it works (high-level)

1. **Data collection** — the system ingests full transaction traces, swap events, pool reserve states, and off-chain metrics (e.g., CEX prices, token metadata).
2. **Feature extraction** — for every pool and token compute features: recent volume, price change in N blocks, unique taker addresses, size relative to TVL, orbiting wallets, and mint patterns.
3. **Scoring & detection** — apply rule-based and ML-augmented models to score events for potential manipulation, sandwich risk, or high slippage susceptibility.
4. **Alert & human review** — when thresholds are breached, create incident records and notify operators who can triage and respond.
5. **Backtest & simulate** — replay historic events to tune detectors and measure false positive/negative rates.
6. **Mitigation playbooks** — guidance for exchanges and custodians on temporary liquidity limits, circuit breakers, and coordination with token maintainers.

## Security & ethics

- This project is designed for *defense, research, and compliance*.
- No private-key handling or signing code that would automate market trades is included. Any write actions must be separately architected with secure signing, human approvals, and proper audit trails.
- Wallet clustering and behavioral analysis is used for fraud detection only; do not implement deanonymization or doxxing features.
- Follow applicable laws, exchange terms of service, and privacy regulations when collecting and storing data.

## Risk disclosure

- Detection heuristics are probabilistic and may generate false positives and false negatives. Use operator review and conservative thresholds when triggering mitigations.
- This toolkit does not remove market risk — it is intended to inform and enable defensive action, not to guarantee safety or profit.
- Backtesting uses historical data and may not capture future market structure changes.
